route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2 1 track 1

!--- Enter this command in order to track a static route.
!--- This is the static route to be installed in the routing 
!--- table while the tracked object is reachable.  The value after
!--- the keyword "track" is a tracking ID you specify. 

route backup 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 198.51.100.2 254

!--- Define the backup route to use when the tracked object is unavailable. 
!--- The administrative distance of the backup route must be greater than 
!--- the administrative distance of the tracked route.
!--- If the primary gateway is unreachable, that route is removed
!--- and the backup route is installed in the routing table
!--- instead of the tracked route.

!--- Configure a new monitoring process with the ID 123.  Specify the
!--- monitoring protocol and the target network object whose availability the tracking
!--- process monitors.  Specify the number of packets to be sent with each poll.
!--- Specify the rate at which the monitor process repeats (in seconds).

sla monitor schedule 123 life forever start-time now

!--- Schedule the monitoring process.  In this case the lifetime
!--- of the process is specified to be forever.  The process is scheduled to begin
!--- at the time this command is entered.  As configured, this command allows the
!--- monitoring configuration specified above to determine how often the testing
!--- occurs.  However, you can schedule this monitoring process to begin in the
!--- future and to only occur at specified times.

Use these show commands in order to verify that your configuration is complete:
show running-config sla monitor – The output of this command displays the SLA commands in the configuration.

Confirm that the Backup Route is Installed (CLI Method)

Enter the show route command in order to confirm that the backup route is installed.
Before the primary ISP fails, the routing table appears similar to this:
ASA# show route

Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP
       D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area
       N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2
       E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2, E - EGP
       i - IS-IS, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2, ia - IS-IS inter area
       * - candidate default, U - per-user static route, o - ODR
       P - periodic downloaded static route

Gateway of last resort is 203.0.113.2 to network 0.0.0.0

After the primary ISP fails, the static route is removed, and the backup route is installed, the routing table appears similar to this:
