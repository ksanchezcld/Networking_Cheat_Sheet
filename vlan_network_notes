- A LAN includes all devices in the same broadcast domain.

- A broadcast domain includes the set of all LAN-connected devices, so that when any of the devices sends a broadcast frame, all the other devices get a copy of the frame.

- Without VLANs, a switch considers all its interfaces to be in the same broadcast domain.

- With VLANs, a switch can configure some interfaces into one broadcast domain and some into another, creating multiple broadcast domains. These individual broadcast domains created by the switch are called virtual LANs (VLAN).


 The following list summarizes the most common reasons for choosing to create smaller broadcast domains (VLANs):

 ■ To reduce CPU overhead on each device by reducing the number of devices that receive each broadcast frame.

 ■ To reduce security risks by reducing the number of hosts that receive copies of frames that the switches flood (broadcasts, multicasts, and unknown unicasts)

 ■ To improve security for hosts that send sensitive data by keeping those hosts on a separate
VLAN.

■ To create more flexible designs that group users by department, or by groups that work together, instead of by physical location.

■ To solve problems more quickly, because the failure domain for many problems is the same set of devices as those in the same broadcast domain.

■ To reduce the workload for the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) by limiting a VLAN to a single access switch.

VLAN Trunking
--------------
- When using VLANs in networks that have multiple interconnected switches, the switches need to use VLAN trunking on the links between the switches.

- VLAN trunking causes the switches to use a process called VLAN tagging.

- VLAN Tagging:  is when the sending switch adds another header to the frame before sending it over the trunk.

- The extra trunking header includes a VLAN identifier (VLAN ID) field so that the sending switch can associate the frame with a particular VLAN ID, and the receiving switch can then know in what VLAN each frame belongs.

- The use of trunking allows switches to pass frames from multiple VLANs over a single physical connection by adding a small header to the Ethernet frame.

- When SW2 receives the frame, it understands that the frame is in VLAN 10. SW2 then removes the VLAN header, forwarding the original frame out its interfaces in VLAN 10.

- Cisco has supported two different trunking protocols over the years: Inter-Switch Link (ISL) and IEEE 802.1Q.
		- 802.1Q inserts an extra 4-byte 802.1Q VLAN header into the original frame’s Ethernet header.
